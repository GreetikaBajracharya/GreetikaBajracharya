## Hi, I'm Greetika Bajracharya

Iâ€™m an enthusiastic student with a strong passion for full-stack development. I enjoy exploring both the front-end and back-end of web development, and I love building projects that let me apply what I learn in a practical way. For me, coding is about learning, building, and improving along the way.
